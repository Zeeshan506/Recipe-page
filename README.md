# Recipe Page

---

## Overview

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor Recipe Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm).  
The goal was to create a clean, responsive recipe page with semantic HTML, styled using Tailwind CSS.

## The Challenge

- Replicate the given Recipe Page design as closely as possible.
- Ensure the layout is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility and readability.
- Apply custom colors, typography, and spacing with Tailwind utilities.
- Style list markers and table elements to match the design.

## Built With

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling and responsiveness (via CDN)
- **Flexbox** – for layout alignment and positioning
- **Google Fonts** – `Outfit` and `Young Serif` for typography

## What I Learned

- Using **Tailwind's marker utilities** to change bullet/number colors (`marker:text-[color]`).
- Creating clean table layouts with `border` and `px/py` spacing utilities.
- Applying **custom hex colors** in Tailwind for precise design matching.
- Combining `flex` and `gap` for vertical spacing in stacked layouts.
- Using **rounded corners** (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-2xl`) to match the design aesthetic.
- Structuring HTML content with semantic tags like `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<table>`.

## Tailwind Tips Learned

- **Custom Colors:**  
  Example: `bg-[#f3e5d8]` for background, `text-[#854632ff]` for text.

- **Marker Styling:**  
  Example: `marker:text-[#854632ff]` changes bullet/number colors.

- **Rounded Corners:**  
  Use `rounded-lg` for subtle curves or `rounded-2xl` for stronger rounding.

- **Spacing Utilities:**  
  Use `gap-4`, `pl-5`, `px-6`, and `py-2` for consistent spacing.

- **Responsive Widths:**  
  Example: `md:w-[620px]` to set a fixed width on medium+ devices.
